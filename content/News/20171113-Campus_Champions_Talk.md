The [XSEDE Campus Champions](https://www.xsede.org/community-engagement/campus-champions) meet every year at the SuperComputing Conference.  During this year's meeting they had a "lighting talk" section as an opportunity to share projects going on in the CI community.  Dirk gave a quick talk about the need for communication training for CI professionals.  We also reached out to the experts at this meeting to see if they had any stories we could use to help ground some of the exercises we are developing as part of the CyberAmbassador curriculum.  

Participants where pointed to the following google doc to include their own stories:

So far we only had a handful of stories. What we lacked in quantity was made up by quality.  Most if not all of the stories have been drafted into CyberAmbassador exercises.

- Thank you Campus Champions!
