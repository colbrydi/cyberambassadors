The NSF funded CyberAmbassador program provides communication, teamwork and leadership training for technically- proficient Cyberinfrastructure (CI) - Professionals. During the first year, we have focused on curriculum development that use interactive exercises and small- group activities to help build participant’s professional skills. After each training, the facilitators will hand out surveys to be filled out by the participants. These surveys evaluate the participants’ satisfaction with the curriculum and the overall training, as well as the impacts the training had on each individual participant. Every survey is specially designed for the specific module taught, the audience, and aspects of the venue (ex. online, in-person, hybrid). 

Since every module, every type of audience, and each training modality are evaluated differently, program evaluators often created survey forms manually. Therefore, a system that automatically generates a survey based on facilitators’ needs are necessary to help program evaluation more effective. This project explores the creation of a “meta-survey,” where facilitators can fill out a questionnaire and have a specialty survey generated for their specific training. We find several systems that can use logic branching to generate a meta-survey. Testing will be done with each one to ensure the most user-friendly logic branch, which is able to generate every single possibility of a survey. The goal is for facilitators to access this meta-survey, answer a few questions about their workshop plan, and get a customized survey form generated  instantly.
