We just finished developing and presenting our latest module called "first contact".  This module looks at new conversations and how you can prepare yourself for unexpected opportunities to build new relationships.  

Overall our CMSE890 graduate students seemed to enjoy the exercise. They gave us some great and I really think this could turn out to be a popular (and practical) module.
