We held an all day CyberAmbassadors workshop at PEARC19 in Chicago.  Although we did put together a slide deck, when we got to PEARC and scouted out our room we realized that we missed the fact that there was no projector.

Since most of the Cyberambassador curriculum focuses on group interactions we always thought it would be easy to adjust the training to not use technology.   Fortunately, Katy and I had almost 14 hours before the workshop started to adjust our plans. We needed to change a few of the activities but by putting a some of the key slides on flip charts the workshop proceeded quite well without technology.  Now that we have tried it out, I think I like not relying on the technology. It is really not needed for the training and is mostly there to keep the facilitators on track.  

Overall PEARC participants were outstanding and the feedback we got on the workshop was quite positive.  We can't wait to do it again next year in Portland!
