Henry Neeman gave his outstanding communications talk "Researcher-Facing I: Talk: Effective Communication (Henry Neeman)" during the [Campus Champion 101](https://www.xsede.org/community-engagement/campus-champions) workshop at [PEARC18](https://www.pearc18.pearc.org/).  

This presentation does a great job explaining the difficulties in communicating with Researchers.  Much of our CyberAmbassador curriculum is pulled from this presentation. A copy of his slides can be found here:
