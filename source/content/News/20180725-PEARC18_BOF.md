The [CyberAmbassador](//colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors) Birds of a Feather Event at the 2018 PEARC Conference was a success!

We had a great turn out and a wonderful discussion about the current state of professional skills training in CI.  The discussion was fairly open but we did prepare a few slides to help move the discussion forward.  These slides can be found here:

The purpose of the event was to engage the community and share our thoughts and ideas. We ended up pulling one of the activities from the cyberambassadors curriculum as a demonstration which seemed to go over quite well with the audience.
