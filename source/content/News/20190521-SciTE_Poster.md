We are so happy to participate and present our work at the [10th Annual International Science of Team Science Conference (SciTS)](https://www.inscits.org/) 2019 in Lansing, Michigan. In this poster, we introduce our curriculum and offer preliminary result from the ongoing evaluation of our program. During the first year, we have focused on curriculum development and explored different training modalities: face-to-face vs. online; short vs. longer sessions. Using a Kirkpatrick model of evaluation, we focused on participants’ reaction (satisfaction) and learning. Our initial result shows that participants were highly satisfied with our “Mastering Complex Conversation,” “Communicating Problems,” and “First contact” curriculum. They also reported to learn more about communication skills.

We also compared the result across groups. First, we compared in-person vs online group; both groups were given a short training of “mastering complex conversation.” Second, we compared the result of the graduate students group vs a-half day training group. Both groups obtained a complete package of our communication skill modules. Despite the difference of demographic composition in terms of age and career stage, we find that the satisfaction score between the online and the in-person group is not significantly different. Similarly, the result of our second comparison is not statistically significant. This shows that our curriculum is highly flexible: it can be applied to any target group and implemented with any training modalities. For more detail information, here is the link to our [poster](http://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/images/FINAL_THE CYBERAMBASSADOR TRAINING PROGRAM.pdf).
