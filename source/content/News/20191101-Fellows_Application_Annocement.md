The CyberAmbassador program is seeking experienced CyberInfrastructure (CI) professionals to train as workshop facilitators for the newly developed CyberAmbassador Professional Skills training program.

Fellows will be trained to facilitate the CyberAmbassador curriculum (covering communications, teamwork and leadership skills) and will host one or more CyberAmbassador workshops during the 12-month fellowship.

At the successful completion of the Fellowship year, participants will earn certification as a **Trained Facilitator** in the CyberAmbassadors program.

### Fellowship Expectations
* **Training.** CyberAmbassador Fellows must attend (in person) the training workshop at Michigan State University **January 28 and 29, 2020**.  Air travel, hotel, and breakfast/lunch expenses during the training will be covered by the grant.  Dinner and other miscellaneous expenses are the responsibility of the Fellows.
* **Facilitating.** CyberAmbassador Fellows agree to schedule, organize and facilitate a minimum of 4 hours of training using the CyberAmbassador curriculum and feedback mechanisms within the fellowship year. Fellows may fulfill this expectation in many ways, such as organizing a workshop for CI or IT personnel at their home institution; offering training at a conference or professional meeting; or providing online training for professional groups. Fellows will receive ongoing advice and support as they organize and facilitate their own CyberAmbassador training(s) - including the option to have an experienced facilitator assist in co-teaching the first workshop.
