Michigan State University is starting up a network of research facilitators from many units across campus.  They hosted a 3 afternoon virtual workshop on July 29-31st to bring this team together.  As part of the workshop the CyberAmbassadors conducted 7 out of the 9 CyberAmbassador modules with a team of trained CyberAmbassador Facilitators.
