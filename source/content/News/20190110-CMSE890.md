This semester we are teaching a in-person class at Michigan State University to provide the CyberAmbassador curriculum in its entirety. The course will consists of ~16 hours of the CyberAmbassador training, ~9 hours of Entering Mentoring curriculum and ~6 hours of discussion-based RCR (responsible conduct of research) training required of all MSU
graduate students prior to graduation.

We hope this course will catalyze curriculum development and provide lot of updates and improvements over the semester.
