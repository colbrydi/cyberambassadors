The CyberAmbassadors program hosted 32 volunteers from across the country at Michigan State University (MSU) on July 18-19 for the inaugural CyberAmbassadors Fellows Program. The program trains facilitators on how to conduct professional skills workshops using the newly developed CyberAmbassadors training curriculum. Over the next year, the CyberAmbassador Fellows will organize, host and facilitate professional skills training in their own communities.  

The first day of this train-the-trainers workshop was dedicated in introducing the curriculum. Participants learned about the modular nature of the curriculum and how it can be adjusted to fit different audiences and formats. The second day was focused on skills and techniques for hosting and facilitating their own CyberAmbassador workshops. Participants got the chance to practice the materials and start planning their future workshops. We look forward to watching the curriculum improve, grow and change as the fellows adopt it as their own.
