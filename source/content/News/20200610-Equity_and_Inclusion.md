Last week we had about 120 people attend a   CyberAmbassador session during the week long  [Virtual Residency](http://www.oscer.ou.edu/virtualresidency2020.php).  This is our fourth Virtual Residency and even though it was entire online I still think it was an outstanding workshop. [Henry Neeman](http://hneeman.oscer.ou.edu/) does such a wonderful job organizing and hosting the event.  

This year we covered the Equity Inclusion and Ethics module.  This is a particularly difficult topic in the best of times and right now the US (and the world) is having a moment where discussions around these topics are extremely important.  To make things even more difficult, online nature of the session made it really hard for me as a facilitator to know how the learning goals were landing with the participants.

With 120 people I decided to remove some of the group work which would only add complexity to the session. We replaced the work with a couple of very good youtube videos:

* [Implicit Bias](https://youtu.be/1JVN2qWSJF4)
* [Strategies for Implicit Bias](https://youtu.be/K-n7el87Dmo)

Generally I prefer a smaller session so that everyone has a chance to talk and we are not excluding anyone in the discussion.  However, based on the informal feedback from the participants I think the session went well.   following is a link to the entire session if you are interested to see for yourself:
