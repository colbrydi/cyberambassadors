This has been the third time CyberAmbassadors program has presented at the annual [Virtual Residency in Oklahoma](http://www.oscer.ou.edu/virtualresidency2019.php). We must be doing something right because the organizers keep inviting us back.  This year we presented three of the Cyber Ambassador Modules:
