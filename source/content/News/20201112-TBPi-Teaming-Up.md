Assigning individuals to work in a group does not automatically create a well-functioning team. The “Teaming Up” session focuses on understanding the conditions necessary for groups to develop into effective teams and offers participants practical tools for encouraging team growth. This session also explores ways to make meetings more effective, including developing strong agendas and ensuring that three key leadership roles are filled (facilitator, notetaker, timekeeper).

Date: Thursday, November 12, 2020
Time: 12:00-1:00pm Eastern (UTC -5)
Presenters: Mark Luchini and David Cribbs
