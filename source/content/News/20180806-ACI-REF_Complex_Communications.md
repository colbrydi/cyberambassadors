We are excited to present some of our newest CyberAmbassador Curriculum developed specifically for the  [2018 ACI-REF Virtual residency](//www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2018.php). We have been given a 90 minute slot to introduce the topic of communicating complex topics.  Below is a link to our slides and links to the practice examples:

One exciting thing about trying out this activity at ACI-REF VR is that a large population of the participants are going to log in remotely.  We are going to use this opportunity to try out groups of three using [Zoom](//zoom.us/) breakout rooms. We are really curious to see how well this type of practice exercise works remotely. This could potentially be a way to save costs on future CyberAmbassador trainings.
