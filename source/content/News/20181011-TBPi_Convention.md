[Tau Beta Pi](//www.tbp.org/Images/Logos/NewLogo.jpg), the engineering honor society, meets every year for their National Convention.  This year the convention is meeting in Denver Co.  Dr. Katy Colbry is presenting a pilot of a new [Engineering Futures](https://www.tbp.org/memb/ef.cfm) module titled "Complex Conversations". This module is based closely on the curriculum developed for the CyberAmbassador training module that we facilitated in August as part of the [ACI-Ref Virtual Residency](http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2018.php).
