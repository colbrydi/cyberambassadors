This poster presents work by CyberAmbassador undergraduate researcher, TJ Van Nguyen, which compares several solutions to develop a website to host and share CyberAmbassador OpenSource educational materials. The goal is to build a system that is easy for instructors to explore, find and modify content to fit their needs. Any modified content should be easily shared back with the community. At the same time the content should be secure and easy to maintain. Instead of recreating the wheel, this research explored the possibility of slightly modifying existing Content Management Systems (CMS). The CMS are categorized using some of their basic attributes (ex: static/dynamic, OpenSource/proprietary, local/remote hosting) and then evaluated based on their usability, security and ease of maintenance. More specifically, this work looks into multiple static site generators and put together templates and prototypes using Jekyll, Pelican and comparing them to dynamic systems such as, Wordpress and Drupal. No CMS is perfect and thus a solution should be selected based on the design criteria and goals of the individual website. However, many areas of education could benefit from a common, easily adapted CMS focused on education materials. This work attempts to identify and provide instructions to quickly develop such a system tailored to the needs of the individual communities.
