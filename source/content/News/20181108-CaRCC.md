We just got finished presenting our latest module to the Campus Research Computing Consortium ([CaRCC](https://carcc.org/)) monthly call for their Research Facing CyberInfrastructer professionals. This session was conducted completely online using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and it turned out to be quite effective.

We are excited to look at the feedback and adding this module to the curriculum.
