I learned about the [National Association for Broader Impacts (NABI)](https://broaderimpacts.net/aris/) from a colleague at MSU, Dr. Laurie Van Egeren, who is a leader in outreach and engagement at the national level. NABI professionals are committed to extending the societal impacts of work funded by NSF (and other funding agencies). This work complements my “day job,” and got me thinking about how the work of CyberAmbassadors is, at its core, an outreach effort that is committed to research making an impact.  I investigated the conference and realized that the work done there, and the research shared, would be a great fit for our project.

Our project seeks to help Cyber professionals to develop and explore professional skills in areas like teamwork and communication so that they can collaborate more effectively.  More specifically, we seek to train facilitators to offer these training opportunities to cyber professionals within their community, to build capacity to serve as many as possible.
How does this relate to outreach and engagement? In many instances, Cyber professionals are embedded in colleges and universities and collaborate with faculty members in diverse disciplines at the same institution. In other instances, cyber professionals work in places like national labs, consulting groups, government agencies, and others, and connect with other professionals whose work relies on technologies that support “big data” and other sophisticated analyses.  This research project seeks to reach out and engage with cyber experts in all of those environments inside and outside universities, in service of research wherever it happens.

Our poster proposal was accepted for the [NABI conference in Tucson](https://broaderimpacts.net/2019-posters/).  I did not quite know in advance how this project would fit into the conversations that typically happen at NABI, but knew that the effort fit into the discussion about “broader impacts,” so was eager to share what we were finding about the impact of our CyberAmbassadors curriculum. I found that many projects aim at community outreach—engaging with members of the public (i.e., children, local community groups)—or people who are less likely to be affiliated with their local university.  Our community was researchers and cyber experts.

The reception to our work was positive. A challenge for many people engaged in “NABI” work is trying to assess impact of…our broader impacts efforts. Because our poster introduced our evaluation efforts and shared preliminary data about the impact of our curriculum, how it was received, and how we used that formative feedback to evolve the development of our modules.
Of the many excellent connections we made, one important connection happened by chance. NABI arranged several “off campus” outings, and one was to the Biosphere 2 project. There, we listened to several excellent talks, including one by Dr. Nirav Merchant, one of the directors of the [Cyverse](http://www.cyverse.org/) project.  Both projects are interested in bridging  the gap between the people who need access to technology for analyzing “big data”: Cyverse focuses on developing data skills  in researchers from other areas, while CyberAmbassadors seeks to help those with “big data” skills become more effective team players and partners. Different approaches toward the same goal to make sure researchers of many backgrounds who need data skills get them, in efficient and effective ways.

The research and community emerging from NABI (recently renamed ARIS) complement the kind of research and scholarship to which I am drawn. I am particularly excited to find this connection because it affords a chance to engage in conversation about how to broadly consider the “community impact” of our work, and recognize that “community” engagement includes different kinds of communities, including “expert” or “scholarly” communities whose work is influenced and enhanced by  the kids of research conducted by projects like CyberAmbassadors.
