We just completed our first full-day communication workshop at the University of Tennessee. There was a small hick-up with flight delays but once things got rolling the workshop turned out great.  This is the first time we have integrated the three separate communication modules:

- First Contact
- Complex conversations
- Communicating a problem

Here is a link to the [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TPq0yFWgpQMjA96AHrnT6WKi32wX4uMn7YMxB2mjItI/edit?usp=sharing)

We (Astri and Dirk), had a great time and hope we get invited back. The people were wonderful!
