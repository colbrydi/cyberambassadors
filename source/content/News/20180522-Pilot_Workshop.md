Title: First Pilot CyberAmbassador Workshop
Date: 2018-05-22
Tags: Presentations, Workshops

The CyberAmbassadors project held its first workshop on Tuesday, May 22, 2018. The session was scheduled for 10:00 am - 5:00 pm in a seminar room of the Computational Mathematics Science and Engineering (CMSE) department at Michigan State University (MSU), with provided lunch and snacks.

There were two major goals of this workshop: 1) test out some of the new curriculum to see how well it works with a small audience and 2) test out surveys for evaluating learning and effectiveness of the materials.  Both goals are intended to just be pilot studies to help us iterate.
