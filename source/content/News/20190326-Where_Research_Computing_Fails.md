Dirk was was invited to give a talk to a newly formed IT Research Support group on MSU's campus.  As the name suggests, the purpose of this group is to find the best ways to help researchers use technology to do their science.  

This talk was a patchwork of existing talks that could turn into a module for the CyberTraining Program.  The discussion by talking about the history of research computing  and  telling a few stories about how research IT is very different than Enterprise IT.  The core of the talk was a group discussion around the idea that the  most common source of failure in any project is in human communication.

Then the discussion moved to campus and national efforts to solve the "human problem" by training a workforce of CI professionals dedicated to supporting research technology.  The talk ended with a quick review of the many national efforts and a plug for our [CyberAmbassador](https://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/) project.
