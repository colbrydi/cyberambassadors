We just completed our first semester long CyberAmbassador class.  

CMSE890 special topics course provided professional skills training in communications, teamwork, ethics and leadership for graduate students, including training in how to be an effective research mentor.
Class materials are drawn from the CyberAmbassador program funded by the National Science
Foundation and the CIMER program funded by the National Institutes of Health, and participating students full filled the six hours of discussion-based RCR (responsible conduct of research) training required of all MSU
graduate students prior to graduation.

It was an amazing group of students and we hope they had as much fun as the instructors.
