Title: Listening Examples
Date: 2018-08-06

Now it is our time practice.  You will be split up into groups of three.  We have three exercises your group will read to practice.  In each group there will:
- The **CI-Professional’s** job is to practice the __listening__ skills we just discussed.
- The **Actor’s** job is to read the scenario pretend to be the __speaker__ on the other side of the conversation.  Have fun with acting and try to help out in the learning experience.
- The **Couch’s** Job is to watch the interaction between the Speaker and Listener and help give advice.  At the end of each practice the coach will point out both good and bad examples during the interaction

# Listener Tools
- Reducing Jargon
- Using good analogies
- Checking for understanding

# Instructions
- Split up into groups of three
- Decide who will start the first example as the CI-professional, Actor and Coach.  
- Each person clicks on the link for their role (Don’t cheat and look at other peoples links).
After completing each example rotate the roles in the following order and move on to the next example.
    - Ci-Professional --> Actor
    - Actor --> Coach
    - Coach --> CI-professional
- There are three (3) practice example. Should take you approximately 5-10 minutes per example.  Do not worry if your group completes all six.
