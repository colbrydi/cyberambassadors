# Coach â€“ Hardware Refresh

As the coach your job is to listen to both the speaker and listener to see if they use the techniques:

- Reducing Jargon
- Using good analogies
- Checking for understanding

If things get stuck suggest one of the techniques.  

Keep notes of when techniques are used or not used to give both positive and negative reinforcement of the end of the activity. Specifically note any jargon that is used.
