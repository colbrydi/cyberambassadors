# CI Professional (Speaker) â€“ Data Center Committee

- Your institution is building a new data center.  A Data Center Committee (DCC) was put together to come up with design specifications, talk to vendors, evaluate bids and present a report with recommendations to the Chief Technical Officer (CTO).  Unfortunately, all of the members of the DCC are from Central IT and no one from the Research Computing Center was included on the DCC even though all of your new equipment will be housed in the new data center.  
- **You are meeting with the CTO to make a case as to why someone from your team should be included on the DCC.**
- You specifically want a person on the DCC to make sure the following needs are met: (1) water cooling system, (2) sufficient power to the rack, (3) enough money is spent on floor space and not on extra facilities your group does not need (ex: generator backup, security gates, etc).
- Remember to avoid jargon, use analogies when appropriate and check for understanding.
