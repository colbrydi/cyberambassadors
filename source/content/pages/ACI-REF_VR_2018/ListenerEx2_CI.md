# CI Professional (Listener) – Software Debugging

- A researcher is trying to use the GNU debugger but is having trouble and sent you some error messages. Unfortunately, the messages by themselves are not very informative and could indicate a problem with the source code or something wrong in the underlying system and how it works with the debugger.
- To help figure out the underlying problem you asked the researcher for a copy of their code and an example so you can test the underlying system.
- The user sent a seemingly terse email saying, “they will figure it out” and you feel they are upset with you but don’t know why. You decided that a face-to-face meeting would be better than email to figure out a problem and have arranged a meeting with the researcher to try and figure out the problem.
