# CI Professional (Speaker) – Hardware Refresh

* You have a distinguished professor running on a older system that needs to be retired.  The system requires a ton of system administrator time to keep running, uses old and out of date software and takes up space/power/resources needed for newer systems in the data center. Unfortunately, what you know of the professor’s code is that there is a justifiable concern that the new operating system, compiler and support libraries will introduce bugs that may be non-trivial to fix.
* You set up a meeting with the professor to explain the problem. Explain the situation to the professor about why the older systems must be retired.
* Remember to avoid jargon, use analogies when appropriate and check for understanding.
