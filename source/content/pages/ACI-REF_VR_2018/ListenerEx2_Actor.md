# Actor (Speaker) – Software Debugging

- You are a postdoc researcher trying to debug some of your code using the GNU debugger.  You sent a simple email to the HPC helpdesk asking them to explain an error message.  Instead of answering your question, the CI facilitator asked for your code.  You are upset because you do not want to share you code. You are even a little worried that they will judge your code and mock you.  All you really want is to understand the error message so you can move forward with your work.
- The CI-Professional has invited you to meet in person, and you’re going – reluctantly. **Say the following to start the conversation: “I don’t know why I’m here! I just wanted you to explain the error code to me so that I could get my work done. And you got all demanding and said you wouldn’t help unless I sent you my code!”**
- You will agree to share your code if the CI-Professional does a good job listening actively and asks you specifically why you don’t want to share your code. It will also help if they explain that they don’t want to judge your code, but instead use it to diagnose the problem.
- Act grateful if they explain that the problem could be with the system and not your code.
