# Actor (Listener) – Bad News

- You are an important professor under a lot of stress to finish your research quickly because of some immediate deadlines. The code you have written is complex and really pushes performance limits on even high-performance systems. However, when you run your code on your institutions HPC it is not running at the speeds you would expect. Your team has looked over every inch of your code multiple times and you’re certain that there is an underlying problem with the HPC. You’ve been emailing and calling the help desk repeatedly because you need the HPC system working at peak performance – yesterday!! – since you are already behind on many important deadlines.
- You’ve been asked to meet with someone at the HPC. Listen as the speaker explains the problem.  **Make sure they acknowledge that the problem is NOT in your code but in the HPC.**  
- Since the problem is on their system, ask how they are going to fix it?  If it can’t be done immediately, what will they do while you wait for a solution?
- **Badger them and be generally grumpy about the poor performance of the HPC until you are asked for YOUR ideas for solving the problem.**  If you are asked for ideas, get friendly and excited and start suggesting possibilities - dedicated time on the HPC! additional resources beyond the standard allocation! time on one of the national systems! whatever you’d like!!
