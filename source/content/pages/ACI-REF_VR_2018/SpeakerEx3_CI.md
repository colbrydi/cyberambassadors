# CI Professional (Speaker) – Bad News

- You have sent up a meeting with a senior professor who is known to be high strung and difficult to work with.  This professor has been trying to get some research done on the HPC, but the code is working slower than expected and the professor has been barraging the help desk with emails and phone calls complaining about the system speeds.  
- After a lot of investigation (and several failed fixes), the HPC system administrators now believe that the problem is not in the professor’s code, but actually in the core high speed network. The issue actually affects all users, but the slow down for others is not noticeable – the only reason the problem was noticed is that this professor’s code really pushes the boundary of performance on the HPC network and therefore the slowdown was noticeable.
- **You have scheduled a meeting, so that you can let the professor know that you’ve found the root cause of the slowdown.  However, you also have to tell the professor that it will take a least a couple of months to find a solution,** because it will require some back and forth with the vendor and maybe a need to upgrade to the latest network drivers – which can’t happen until the next scheduled maintenance window.
- Remember to avoid jargon, use analogies when appropriate and check for understanding.
