# Actor (Listener) – Data Center Committee

- You are the Chief Technical Officer (CTO) for your institution. You recently put together a Data Center Committee (DCC) to come up with design specifications, talk to vendors, evaluate bids and present you a report with recommendations.  **You are meeting with a member of the Research Computing Center who asked to discuss the DCC.**
- You’re confident that the DCC will develop a plan that meets the needs of everyone on campus, because the requirements for central IT are so strict!  For instance, the new facility will provide “five 9s” service (meaning 99.999% uptime), which should be enough for anyone on campus.  The DCC will also focus its money on the important things – for instance, your staff has already ruled out adding a liquid cooling system because that’s not required for an enterprise computing system.
- You did not include anyone from the RCC team on the DCC because they are not under your chain of command (so you cannot dictate their time) plus you feel that big committees are not as productive. **You will resist adding an RCC member to the design team UNTIL the speaker makes a good analogy that doesn’t use any jargon.**
