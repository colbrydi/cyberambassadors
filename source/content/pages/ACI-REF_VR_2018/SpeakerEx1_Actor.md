# Actor (Listener) – Hardware Refresh

* You are a distinguished professor whose research relies on a system that was purchased 7 years ago. You know that the HPC policy is to retire systems that are older than 5 years and you suspect that this is the reason for the meeting.  Unfortunately, the students that wrote the code are long graduated and you know from prior experience upgrades to things like a new operating system, compiler and support libraries will introduce bugs to your code that are non-trivial to fix.
* Although you have the resources to hire a programmer to refresh your code the time and effort required to update the code will disrupt your research workflow.  
* You go into the meeting with the plan to actively resist the upgrade and try to keep your existing system running.
* Act as if you do not understand any ”Computer Jargon”
* You will agree to apply only after the CI-professional has asked about the your timeline to complete the project.
