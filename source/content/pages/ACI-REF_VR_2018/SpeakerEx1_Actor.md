# Actor (Listener) – Hardware Refresh

- You are a distinguished professor whose research relies on a system that was purchased 7 years ago. You know that the HPC policy is to retire systems that are older than 5 years and you suspect that this is why you’ve been called in to meet with the CI-Professional.
- The students that wrote the code are long graduated and you know from prior experience upgrades to things like a new operating system, compiler and support libraries will introduce bugs to your code that are non-trivial to fix.
- Although you have the resources to hire a programmer to refresh your code the time and effort required to move to new hardware will disrupt your research workflow.  
- ** You go into the meeting with the plan to actively resist the upgrade and try to keep your existing system running. **
- Act as if you do not understand any ”Computer Jargon”
- **You will agree to comply with the CI-Professional’s request that you move to new hardware ONLY AFTER** the CI-professional has asked about your _**timeline**_ to complete the project.
