<h2>About the Program</h2>
<p>The NSF-funded CyberAmbassador program offers training in communication, teamwork and leadership skills for CyberInfrastructure (CI) Professionals. The training is free and will be offered virtually during Summer 2021. The training offers opportunities to practice professional skills in the context of multidisciplinary research, and is appropriate for college students, faculty, staff, and professionals in all STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) fields. Participants will earn a certificate for completing the full training series. Interested individuals will also have the opportunity to apply for the CyberAmbassador Fellows program, which provides additional training to prepare facilitators to deliver this program at their workplace, campus or community. For more information on the CyberAmbassadors project, please visit: http://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors </p>
<h2>Certification Requirements</h2>
<p>Earning a certificate requires completing all three modules of the CyberAmbassadors program: Communications, Teamwork, and Leadership.  These are highly interactive sessions with small and large group activities that require speaking, listening and typing. Participants will need access to appropriate technology (computer, microphone, webcam, speakers/headphones, web browsers, high speed internet) and to a sufficiently private/quiet space where they can fully engage in training.</p>
<h2>Certification Opportunities</h2>
<p>During Summer 2021, the CyberAmbassadors Certification program will be offered VIRTUALLY (via zoom) as a series of three-hour sessions over three weeks. Participants are encouraged to register for one complete series (either July or August), but may mix-and-match individual sessions if necessary. Each module (Communication, Teamwork, Leadership) must be completed in order to earn the CyberAmbassadors Certification.** All session times are based on Eastern Daylight Time (UTC -4).</p>

<h2>Registration Information</h2>
<p>The CyberAmbassadors Certification program is offered free of charge and is appropriate for college students, faculty, staff and professionals in STEM fields. Advance registration is required: https://tinyurl.com/CAsummer2021
For more information, please contact Dr. Dirk Colbry (colbrydi@msu.edu).</p>
<p>** We understand that life happens, and that you may not be able to participate in all sessions as planned. There will be other training opportunities in the future, and we will try to accommodate individuals who wish to complete the certification process at a later time.</p></div>
