<p>The CyberAmbassador program is seeking experienced CyberInfrastructure (CI) professionals to train as workshop facilitators for the newly developed CyberAmbassador Professional Skills training program.</p>
<p>Fellows will be trained to facilitate the CyberAmbassador curriculum (covering communications, teamwork and leadership skills) and will host one or more CyberAmbassador workshops during the 12-month fellowship.</p>
<p>At the successful completion of the Fellowship year, participants will earn certification as a <strong>Trained Facilitator</strong> and be named a <strong>Founding Fellow</strong> of the CyberAmbassadors program.</p>
<h3>Fellowship Expectations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Training.</strong> CyberAmbassador Fellows must attend (in person) the training workshop at Michigan State University <strong>July 18-19, 2019</strong>.  There is no cost to participate, and travel expenses will be reimbursed (note that a valid Social Security number is required in order to receive reimbursements).</li>
<li><strong>Facilitating.</strong> CyberAmbassador Fellows agree to schedule, organize and facilitate a minimum of 4 hours of training using the CyberAmbassador curriculum and feedback mechanisms within the fellowship year (between August 1, 2019, and September 1, 2020). Fellows may fulfill this expectation in many ways, such as organizing a workshop for CI or IT personnel at their home institution; offering training at a conference or professional meeting; or providing online training for professional groups. Fellows will receive ongoing advice and support as they organize and facilitate their own CyberAmbassador training(s) - including the option to have an experienced facilitator assist in co-teaching the first workshop.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Apply by June 12, 2019!</h3>
<p>The application process requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>A one-page letter describing: (1) why you want to be a CyberAmbassador Fellow; (2) what you hope to contribute to the program; and (3) how you would fulfill the expectation to organize and facilitate a minimum of 4 hours of training during the fellowship year (please indicate where, when, and to what audience you might present the CyberAmbassadors program).</li>
<li>Your current resume or CV</li>
<li>Completion of the brief application form (which requests that you submit the two documents listed above):</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/CyberAmbassadorFellow">Google Application Form</a></p>
