<p>We held an all day CyberAmbassadors workshop at PEARC19 in Chicago.  Although we did put together a slide deck, when we got to PEARC and scouted out our room we realized that we missed the fact that there was no projector.</p>
<p>Since most of the Cyberambassador curriculum focuses on group interactions we always thought it would be easy to adjust the training to not use technology.   Fortunately, Katy and I had almost 14 hours before the workshop started to adjust our plans. We needed to change a few of the activities but by putting a some of the key slides on flip charts the workshop proceeded quite well without technology.  Now that we have tried it out, I think I like not relying on the technology. It is really not needed for the training and is mostly there to keep the facilitators on track.  </p>
<p>Overall PEARC participants were outstanding and the feedback we got on the workshop was quite positive.  We can't wait to do it again next year in Portland!</p></div>
