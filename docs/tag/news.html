<p>The CyberAmbassador program is seeking experienced CyberInfrastructure (CI) professionals to train as workshop facilitators for the newly developed CyberAmbassador Professional Skills training program.</p>
<p>Fellows will be trained to facilitate the CyberAmbassador curriculum (covering communications, teamwork and leadership skills) and will host one or more CyberAmbassador workshops during the 12-month fellowship.</p>
<p>At the successful completion of the Fellowship year, participants will earn certification as a <strong>Trained Facilitator</strong> in the CyberAmbassadors program.</p>
<h3>Fellowship Expectations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Training.</strong> CyberAmbassador Fellows must attend (in person) the training workshop at Michigan State University <strong>January 28 and 29, 2020</strong>.  Air travel, hotel, and breakfast/lunch expenses during the training will be covered by the grant.  Dinner and other miscellaneous expenses are the responsibility of the Fellows.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitating.</strong> CyberAmbassador Fellows agree to schedule, organize and facilitate a minimum of 4 hours of training using the CyberAmbassador curriculum and feedback mechanisms within the fellowship year. Fellows may fulfill this expectation in many ways, such as organizing a workshop for CI or IT personnel at their home institution; offering training at a conference or professional meeting; or providing online training for professional groups. Fellows will receive ongoing advice and support as they organize and facilitate their own CyberAmbassador training(s) - including the option to have an experienced facilitator assist in co-teaching the first workshop.</li>
