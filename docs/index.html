<p>Having been exposed to the NSF Cyber Ambassador project through participation in several research facilitation-related national organizations (CaRCC, ACI-REF VR, Campus Champions), I’ve had the opportunity to not only learn about the training content, but also to experience several of the various training modules and activities offered. Last December a significant portion of my time became dedicated to the NSF project, <a href="https://researchsoc.iu.edu/">Research Security Operations Center</a> (ResearchSOC), a collaborative effort of Indiana University (Principal Investigator (PI), Von Welch), Duke University, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and University of California San Diego, and it struck me that the Cyber Ambassador project materials could greatly contribute to our efforts.</p>
<p>UC San Diego is responsible for the education and outreach piece of the ResearchSOC award and as such is developing training workshops for security professionals in higher education, with an emphasis on security principles as applied to research projects. Such a focus is a significant departure from the business of securing enterprise applications, networks, and systems and requires specific training to work successfully with faculty researchers with sponsored projects. Part of this workshop introduces research facilitation skills and techniques, a large part of which is communication focused. This is where the Cyber Ambassador project was engaged.</p>
<p>Cyber Ambassador’s PI Dirk Colbry worked closely with us to create customized training module content and scripted activities for an audience of security professionals. We tailored two scenarios for small group activities which were carried out at the EDUCAUSE Security Professionals Conference for a half-day pre-conference workshop on May 13, 2019. The activities were very well received by the attendees who were mainly senior security officers, directors, and security analysts. Building upon the success of the half-day workshop we hope to work with Dr. Colbry and the Cyber Ambassadors team to further develop even more specifically-tailored content that will become an integral part of an expanded 3-day version of the ResearchSOC workshop to be offered in December, 2019. We are very grateful to the Cyber Ambassadors project for this collaborative opportunity and for the impactful content they have helped us to deliver.</p></div>
