&lt;p&gt;We held an all day CyberAmbassadors workshop at PEARC19 in Chicago.  Although we did put together a slide deck, when we got to PEARC and scouted out our room we realized that we missed the fact that there was no projector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most of the Cyberambassador curriculum focuses on group interactions we always thought it would be easy to adjust the training to not use technology.   Fortunately, Katy and I had almost 14 hours before the workshop started to adjust our plans. We needed to change a few of the activities but by putting a some of the key slides on flip charts the workshop proceeded quite well without technology.  Now that we have tried it out, I think I like not relying on the technology. It is really not needed for the training and is mostly there to keep the facilitators on track.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall PEARC participants were outstanding and the feedback we got on the workshop was quite positive.  We can't wait to do it again next year in Portland!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Workshops"></category><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Inaugural CyberAmbassadors Fellows Training Workshop</title><link href="https://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/inaugural-cyberambassadors-fellows-training-workshop.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Lilly Glosser</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2019-07-18:/cyberambassadors/inaugural-cyberambassadors-fellows-training-workshop.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Group Picture of Inaugural Fellows" src="http://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/images/Fellows_Group.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CyberAmbassadors program hosted 32 volunteers from across the country at Michigan State University (MSU) on July 18-19 for the inaugural CyberAmbassadors Fellows Program. The program trains facilitators on how to conduct professional skills workshops using the newly developed CyberAmbassadors training curriculum. Over the next year, the CyberAmbassador Fellows will organize, host and facilitate professional skills training in their own communities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day of this train-the-trainers workshop was dedicated in introducing the curriculum. Participants learned about the modular nature of the curriculum and how it can be adjusted to fit different audiences and formats. The second day was focused on skills and techniques for hosting and facilitating their own CyberAmbassador workshops. Participants got the chance to practice the materials and start planning their future workshops. We look forward to watching the curriculum improve, grow and change as the fellows adopt it as their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been exposed to the NSF Cyber Ambassador project through participation in several research facilitation-related national organizations (CaRCC, ACI-REF VR, Campus Champions), I’ve had the opportunity to not only learn about the training content, but also to experience several of the various training modules and activities offered. Last December a significant portion of my time became dedicated to the NSF project, &lt;a href="https://researchsoc.iu.edu/"&gt;Research Security Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; (ResearchSOC), a collaborative effort of Indiana University (Principal Investigator (PI), Von Welch), Duke University, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and University of California San Diego, and it struck me that the Cyber Ambassador project materials could greatly contribute to our efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UC San Diego is responsible for the education and outreach piece of the ResearchSOC award and as such is developing training workshops for security professionals in higher education, with an emphasis on security principles as applied to research projects. Such a focus is a significant departure from the business of securing enterprise applications, networks, and systems and requires specific training to work successfully with faculty researchers with sponsored projects. Part of this workshop introduces research facilitation skills and techniques, a large part of which is communication focused. This is where the Cyber Ambassador project was engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber Ambassador’s PI Dirk Colbry worked closely with us to create customized training module content and scripted activities for an audience of security professionals. We tailored two scenarios for small group activities which were carried out at the EDUCAUSE Security Professionals Conference for a half-day pre-conference workshop on May 13, 2019. The activities were very well received by the attendees who were mainly senior security officers, directors, and security analysts. Building upon the success of the half-day workshop we hope to work with Dr. Colbry and the Cyber Ambassadors team to further develop even more specifically-tailored content that will become an integral part of an expanded 3-day version of the ResearchSOC workshop to be offered in December, 2019. We are very grateful to the Cyber Ambassadors project for this collaborative opportunity and for the impactful content they have helped us to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Workshops"></category><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Now Accepting Application for CyberAmbassadors Fellows Program</title><link href="https://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/now-accepting-application-for-cyberambassadors-fellows-program.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2019-06-12:/cyberambassadors/now-accepting-application-for-cyberambassadors-fellows-program.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right," alt="CyberAmbassador Logo" hspace="10" src="//colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/images/cyber.png" width="200,"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellows will be trained to facilitate the CyberAmbassador curriculum (covering communications, teamwork and leadership skills) and will host one or more CyberAmbassador workshops during the 12-month fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the successful completion of the Fellowship year, participants will earn certification as a &lt;strong&gt;Trained Facilitator&lt;/strong&gt; and be named a &lt;strong&gt;Founding Fellow&lt;/strong&gt; of the CyberAmbassadors program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fellowship Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training.&lt;/strong&gt; CyberAmbassador Fellows must attend (in person) the training workshop at Michigan State University &lt;strong&gt;July 18-19, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;.  There is no cost to participate, and travel expenses will be reimbursed (note that a valid Social Security number is required in order to receive reimbursements).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitating.&lt;/strong&gt; CyberAmbassador Fellows agree to schedule, organize and facilitate a minimum of 4 hours of training using the CyberAmbassador curriculum and feedback mechanisms within the fellowship year (between August 1, 2019, and September 1, 2020). Fellows may fulfill this expectation in many ways, such as organizing a workshop for CI or IT personnel at their home institution; offering training at a conference or professional meeting; or providing online training for professional groups. Fellows will receive ongoing advice and support as they organize and facilitate their own CyberAmbassador training(s) - including the option to have an experienced facilitator assist in co-teaching the first workshop.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are so happy to participate and present our work at the &lt;a href="https://www.inscits.org/"&gt;10th Annual International Science of Team Science Conference (SciTS)&lt;/a&gt; 2019 in Lansing, Michigan. In this poster, we introduce our curriculum and offer preliminary result from the ongoing evaluation of our program. During the first year, we have focused on curriculum development and explored different training modalities: face-to-face vs. online; short vs. longer sessions. Using a Kirkpatrick model of evaluation, we focused on participants’ reaction (satisfaction) and learning. Our initial result shows that participants were highly satisfied with our “Mastering Complex Conversation,” “Communicating Problems,” and “First contact” curriculum. They also reported to learn more about communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also compared the result across groups. First, we compared in-person vs online group; both groups were given a short training of “mastering complex conversation.” Second, we compared the result of the graduate students group vs a-half day training group. Both groups obtained a complete package of our communication skill modules. Despite the difference of demographic composition in terms of age and career stage, we find that the satisfaction score between the online and the in-person group is not significantly different. Similarly, the result of our second comparison is not statistically significant. This shows that our curriculum is highly flexible: it can be applied to any target group and implemented with any training modalities.

&lt;p&gt;I learned about the &lt;a href="https://broaderimpacts.net/aris/"&gt;National Association for Broader Impacts (NABI)&lt;/a&gt; from a colleague at MSU, Dr. Laurie Van Egeren, who is a leader in outreach and engagement at the national level. NABI professionals are committed to extending the societal impacts of work funded by NSF (and other funding agencies). This …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right," alt="NABI Logo" hspace="10" src="http://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/images/NABI2019.jpg" width="50%,"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned about the &lt;a href="https://broaderimpacts.net/aris/"&gt;National Association for Broader Impacts (NABI)&lt;/a&gt; from a colleague at MSU, Dr. Laurie Van Egeren, who is a leader in outreach and engagement at the national level. NABI professionals are committed to extending the societal impacts of work funded by NSF (and other funding agencies). This work complements my “day job,” and got me thinking about how the work of CyberAmbassadors is, at its core, an outreach effort that is committed to research making an impact.  I investigated the conference and realized that the work done there, and the research shared, would be a great fit for our project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our project seeks to help Cyber professionals to develop and explore professional skills in areas like teamwork and communication so that they can collaborate more effectively.  More specifically, we seek to train facilitators to offer these training opportunities to cyber professionals within their community, to build capacity to serve as many as possible.
How does this relate to outreach and engagement? In many instances, Cyber professionals are embedded in colleges and universities and collaborate with faculty members in diverse disciplines at the same institution. In other instances, cyber professionals work in places like national labs, consulting groups, government agencies, and others, and connect with other professionals whose work relies on technologies that support “big data” and other sophisticated analyses.  This research project seeks to reach out and engage with cyber experts in all of those environments inside and outside universities, in service of research wherever it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our poster proposal was accepted for the &lt;a href="https://broaderimpacts.net/2019-posters/"&gt;NABI conference in Tucson&lt;/a&gt;.  I did not quite know in advance how this project would fit into the conversations that typically happen at NABI, but knew that the effort fit into the discussion about “broader impacts,” so was eager to share what we were finding about the impact of our CyberAmbassadors curriculum. I found that many projects aim at community outreach—engaging with members of the public (i.e., children, local community groups)—or people who are less likely to be affiliated with their local university.  Our community was researchers and cyber experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reception to our work was positive. A challenge for many people engaged in “NABI” work is trying to assess impact of…our broader impacts efforts. Because our poster introduced our evaluation efforts and shared preliminary data about the impact of our curriculum, how it was received, and how we used that formative feedback to evolve the development of our modules.
Of the many excellent connections we made, one important connection happened by chance. NABI arranged several “off campus” outings, and one was to the Biosphere 2 project. There, we listened to several excellent talks, including one by Dr. Nirav Merchant, one of the directors of the &lt;a href="http://www.cyverse.org/"&gt;Cyverse&lt;/a&gt; project.  Both projects are interested in bridging  the gap between the people who need access to technology for analyzing “big data”: Cyverse focuses on developing data skills  in researchers from other areas, while CyberAmbassadors seeks to help those with “big data” skills become more effective team players and partners. Different approaches toward the same goal to make sure researchers of many backgrounds who need data skills get them, in efficient and effective ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research and community emerging from NABI (recently renamed ARIS) complement the kind of research and scholarship to which I am drawn. I am particularly excited to find this connection because it affords a chance to engage in conversation about how to broadly consider the “community impact” of our work, and recognize that “community” engagement includes different kinds of communities, including “expert” or “scholarly” communities whose work is influenced and enhanced by  the kids of research conducted by projects like CyberAmbassadors.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Presentations"></category></entry><entry><title>That's a wrap!

&lt;p&gt;This poster presents work by CyberAmbassador undergraduate researcher, TJ Van Nguyen, which compares several solutions to develop a website to host and share CyberAmbassador OpenSource educational materials. The goal is to build a system that is easy for instructors to explore, find and modify content to fit their needs. Any modified content should be easily shared back with the community. At the same time the content should be secure and easy to maintain. Instead of recreating the wheel, this research explored the possibility of slightly modifying existing Content Management Systems (CMS). The CMS are categorized using some of their basic attributes (ex: static/dynamic, OpenSource/proprietary, local/remote hosting) and then evaluated based on their usability, security and ease of maintenance. More specifically, this work looks into multiple static site generators and put together templates and prototypes using Jekyll, Pelican and comparing them to dynamic systems such as, Wordpress and Drupal. No CMS is perfect and thus a solution should be selected based on the design criteria and goals of the individual website. However, many areas of education could benefit from a common, easily adapted CMS focused on education materials. This work attempts to identify and provide instructions to quickly develop such a system tailored to the needs of the individual communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was a patchwork of existing talks that could turn into a module for the CyberTraining Program.  The discussion by talking about the history of research computing  and  telling a few stories about how research IT is very different than Enterprise IT.  The core of the talk was a group discussion around the idea that the  most common source of failure in any project is in human communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the discussion moved to campus and national efforts to solve the "human problem" by training a workforce of CI professionals dedicated to supporting research technology.  The talk ended with a quick review of the many national efforts and a plug for our &lt;a href="https://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/"&gt;CyberAmbassador&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One exciting thing about trying out this activity at ACI-REF VR is that a large population of the participants are going to log in remotely.  We are going to use this opportunity to try out groups of three using &lt;a href="//zoom.us/"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; breakout rooms. We are really curious to see how well this type of practice exercise works remotely. This could potentially be a way to save costs on future CyberAmbassador trainings.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>PEARC18 Birds of a Feather (BOF)</title><link href="https://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/pearc18-birds-of-a-feather-bof.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-25T17:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-25T17:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-07-25:/cyberambassadors/pearc18-birds-of-a-feather-bof.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right," alt="BOF Logo" hspace="10" src="//galaxyproject.org/images/logos/GCC2014_BoF_LogoSquare.png" width="20%,"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Description: &lt;/strong&gt;
A number of professional skills training programs and resources have been developed in recent years, in part due to the efforts of the NSF CyberTraining Initiative. The goal of this BOF is to bring these groups together and explore ways to share information and coordinate efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the integration of CI in research continues, CI Professionals find themselves tackling problems and consulting on projects that are increasingly complex and collaborative. In order to respond to these various requests, CI Professionals need both the expertise to solve computational challenges and the professional skills to work effectively with individuals and teams who have diverse backgrounds, experiences, and goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers of this BOF will facilitate conversations and brainstorming activities within this interactive session, with the goal of identifying opportunities to build on each other’s success and develop ongoing collaborations. For example, authors of open-source professional skills curricula might meet experienced facilitators with an interest in bringing their content to new audiences. Or content developers might identify gaps in available resources and develop new partnerships to address these needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This BOF is proposed by a team that has received NSF CyberTraining funds to develop open-source, professional skills training in communication, teamwork and leadership for CI Professionals along with a “train the trainers” module to facilitate national access to these materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Presentations"></category></entry><entry><title>Campus Champions 101 at PEARC18</title><link href="https://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/campus-champions-101-at-pearc18.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-23T11:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-23T11:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-07-23:/cyberambassadors/campus-champions-101-at-pearc18.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right," alt="Campus Champion Logo" hspace="10" src="https://www.xsede.org/wwwteragrid/archive/image/image_gallery%3Fuuid=554fecca-1a37-44d0-826f-afad9470153d&amp;amp;groupId=298192&amp;amp;t=1291845274821" width="20%,"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We also reached out to the experts at this meeting to see if they had any stories we could use to help ground some of the exercises we are developing as part of the CyberAmbassador curriculum.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants where pointed to the following google doc to include their own stories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we only had a handful of stories. What we lacked in quantity was made up by quality.  Most if not all of the stories have been drafted into CyberAmbassador exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop is an amazing resource for CI Facilitators trying to get a start on their campus and there were many talks/activities and is closely related to the CyberAmbassador program.  In particular the following activities overlap with the goals of the CyberAmbassador program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="//www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_effectivecommunication_neeman_20170731.pdf"&gt;Effective Communication: How to Talk to Researchers about Their Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the week Henry Neeman also had lots of small useful communication tidbits and we had an amazing Ad-hoc talk about how to communicate effectively using email.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, just before attending the CyberAmbassador grant was funded we talked to the ACI-REF VR organizers (Henry Neman and Dana Brunson) about the grant and they found time in the schedule to let Dirk Talk with the participants.  The goal of this talk was to introduce the participants to the new CyberAmbassador program and hopefully generate some interest in participation.  Here is a link to the slides used in the talk:
- &lt;a href="//www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_cyberambassadors_colbry_20170802.pdf"&gt;CyberAmbassador&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;78&lt;strong&gt;+40&lt;/strong&gt; people were at the conference with &lt;strong&gt;40&lt;/strong&gt; in person and 78 calling in remotely. Ad-hoc feedback seemed to indicate an excitement for the program.  Names were gathered to be added to the CyberAmbassador newsletter email list.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Presentations"></category></entry></feed>
