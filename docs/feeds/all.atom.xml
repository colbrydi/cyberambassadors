&lt;p&gt;One exciting thing about trying out this activity at ACI-REF VR is that a large population of the participants are going to log in remotely.  We are going to use this opportunity to try out groups of three using &lt;a href="//zoom.us/"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; breakout rooms. We are really curious to see how well this type of practice exercise works remotely. This could potentially be a way to save costs on future CyberAmbassador trainings.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>PEARC18 Birds of a Feather (BOF)</title><link href="https://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/pearc18-birds-of-a-feather-bof.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-25T17:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-25T17:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-07-25:/cyberambassadors/pearc18-birds-of-a-feather-bof.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right," alt="BOF Logo" hspace="10" src="//galaxyproject.org/images/logos/GCC2014_BoF_LogoSquare.png" width="20%,"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Description: &lt;/strong&gt;
A number of professional skills training programs and resources have been developed in recent years, in part due to the efforts of the NSF CyberTraining Initiative. The goal of this BOF is to bring these groups together and explore ways to share information and coordinate efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the integration of CI in research continues, CI Professionals find themselves tackling problems and consulting on projects that are increasingly complex and collaborative. In order to respond to these various requests, CI Professionals need both the expertise to solve computational challenges and the professional skills to work effectively with individuals and teams who have diverse backgrounds, experiences, and goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers of this BOF will facilitate conversations and brainstorming activities within this interactive session, with the goal of identifying opportunities to build on each other’s success and develop ongoing collaborations. For example, authors of open-source professional skills curricula might meet experienced facilitators with an interest in bringing their content to new audiences. Or content developers might identify gaps in available resources and develop new partnerships to address these needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This BOF is proposed by a team that has received NSF CyberTraining funds to develop open-source, professional skills training in communication, teamwork and leadership for CI Professionals along with a “train the trainers” module to facilitate national access to these materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Presentations"></category></entry><entry><title>Campus Champions 101 at PEARC18</title><link href="https://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/campus-champions-101-at-pearc18.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-23T11:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-23T11:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-07-23:/cyberambassadors/campus-champions-101-at-pearc18.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right," alt="Campus Champion Logo Logo" hspace="10" src="https://www.xsede.org/wwwteragrid/archive/image/image_gallery%3Fuuid=554fecca-1a37-44d0-826f-afad9470153d&amp;amp;groupId=298192&amp;amp;t=1291845274821" width="20%,"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants where pointed to the following google doc to include their own stories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop is an amazing resource for CI Facilitators trying to get a start on their campus and there were many talks/activities and is closely related to the CyberAmbassador program.  In particular the following activities overlap with the goals of the CyberAmbassador program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the week Henry Neeman also had lots of small useful communication tidbits and we had an amazing Ad-hoc talk about how to communicate effectively using email.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, just before attending the CyberAmbassador grant was funded we talked to the ACI-REF VR organizers (Henry Neman and Dana Brunson) about the grant and they found time in the schedule to let Dirk Talk with the participants.  The goal of this talk was to introduce the participants to the new CyberAmbassador program and hopefully generate some interest in participation.  Here is a link to the slides used in the talk:

&lt;p&gt;78&lt;strong&gt;+40&lt;/strong&gt; people were at the conference with &lt;strong&gt;40&lt;/strong&gt; in person and 78 calling in remotely.
